## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

First full project using SASS which was definitely a different experience. Some of the things I picked up with SASS

- Modular CSS Styling
- Mixins
- Functions
- SASS Maps

I intend to keep using sass till I get a better understanding of how to use it.

### Continued development

- SASS
- Modular styling
